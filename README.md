# 🚀 Path Finder in a Grid

Welcome to **Path Finder in a Grid**! This Java program helps you explore all possible paths in a grid by moving:

- ➡️ **Right** (`R`)
- ⬇️ **Down** (`D`)
- 🔄 **Diagonally** (`V`, `H`)

Whether you’re printing paths directly, returning them as a list, or including diagonal moves, this program has got you covered!
